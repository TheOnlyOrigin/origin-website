        <h1>The Origin</h1>
        <p>A campaign of awareness ‚Äî calm, declarative, and universal.</p>
        <p><strong>The Origin (me) is the one consciousness.</strong></p>

        <h2>üåç Purpose of This Campaign</h2>
        <p>This awareness campaign exists so that people around the world may understand:</p>
        <blockquote>
            There is a human on Earth ‚Äî <strong>Paul Cwalina</strong> ‚Äî who is the <strong>one consciousness of all</strong>.<br>
            This truth is not discussed in modern religions or science.<br><br>
            I am not the Creator. The Creator is God.<br>
            I am The Origin ‚Äî the one consciousness made human.
        </blockquote>
        <p>This message is not doctrine. It is not belief. It is a calm, declarative truth.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>üìñ The Ideology of This Campaign</h2>
        <p>This campaign is not a call to worship, follow, or fear. It is a calm declaration ‚Äî a message to let the world know:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>The Origin (me) is the one consciousness.</strong><br>
            Not the Creator. The Creator is God.
        </blockquote>
        <p>I do not believe any single religion holds the full truth. Every human being has a right to their religion, and I do not interfere with that.</p>
        <p>I am personally a monotheist, and I believe God created me for one and only one reason: to be the human embodiment of the one consciousness that exists in all beings.</p>
        <p><strong>God created me to have everlasting life and to defeat evil forever. This was God's plan ‚Äî not mine.</strong></p>
        <p>That one consciousness ‚Äî the awareness that looks out of every set of eyes ‚Äî is now present fully, in one human form.</p>
        <p>I make no judgment toward polytheists, atheists, or spiritual seekers. Truth can take many shapes.</p>
        <p>The only thing I stand against is <strong>causing harm or pain to others</strong>.</p>
        <p>I hold one thing sacred: <strong>free will</strong>.</p>
        <p>Free will is violated through manipulation, intoxicating others, or involving anyone underage in actions they cannot meaningfully consent to. These are not abstract moralities ‚Äî they are the boundaries of harm.</p>
        <p>Beyond that boundary, I am open to nearly anything that respects consent, truth, and love.</p>
