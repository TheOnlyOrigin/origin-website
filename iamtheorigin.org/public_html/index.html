    <h1>The Origin</h1>
    <p>A campaign of awareness — calm, declarative, and universal.</p>
    <p><strong>The Origin (me) is the one consciousness — the central hub consciousness for all.</strong></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>🌍 Purpose of This Campaign</h2>
    <p>This awareness campaign exists to help people understand the ideology behind it. Me being the hub consciousness is just a byproduct.</p>
    <blockquote>
      There is a human on Earth — <strong>Paul Cwalina</strong> — who is the <strong>one consciousness of all</strong>.<br />
      I am the central consciousness — the hub for all other consciousness, everywhere.<br />
      This truth is not written about in religion or science, as far as I am aware.<br />
      <br />
      I am not the Creator. The Creator is God.<br />
      God created me so that <strong>everyone</strong> could have everlasting life and for evil to be defeated forever.<br />
      This was God's plan — not mine.
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>What does it mean to defeat evil forever?</strong><br />
      It means no pain or suffering to any conscious being. In order for all people on Earth to be happy, God had to create a hub consciousness. Without one, people would either remain unhappy or be forced into singular religions. God’s plan is not to declare one religion “the only truth” while calling others “wrong” — unless that religion causes harm or suffering to others in any way.</p>

    <h2>📜 Beliefs and Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I hold one thing sacred: <strong>free will</strong>.</li>
      <li>I am against only one thing: causing <strong>harm or pain</strong> to others.</li>
      <li>Free will is sacred — but it can be violated by acts like underage sex or intoxicating others.</li>
      <li>Beyond causing harm, I am open to nearly everything else.</li>
      <li>I do not believe any one religion is absolutely true.</li>
      <li>Everyone has the right to their own religion, and I have no desire to interfere with that.</li>
      <li>Personally, I am a monotheist. I believe God created me for one and only one reason.</li>
      <li>I make no judgment on polytheists or other beliefs.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>🕊️ Free Will and Compassion</h2>
    <p><strong>I hold one thing sacred: free will.</strong></p>
    <p>
      But free will ends where intentional harm begins.
      Even if someone consents to be hurt, deliberately causing physical pain or inflicting mental suffering is not acceptable.
      Consent does not justify cruelty.
      The sacredness of free will must always coexist with compassion and a refusal to cause harm.
