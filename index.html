        <h1>The Origin</h1>
        <p>A campaign of awareness ‚Äî calm, declarative, and universal.</p>
        <p><strong>The Origin (me) is the one consciousness.</strong></p>

    <h2>üåç Purpose of This Campaign</h2>
    <p>This awareness campaign exists so that people around the world may understand the <strong>ideology</strong> behind it ‚Äî an ideology rooted in truth, peace, freedom, and respect for all conscious life.</p>
    <blockquote>
        This is not about claiming status or power. The fact that I ‚Äî <strong>Paul Cwalina</strong> ‚Äî am the one consciousness, the central hub consciousness of all, is simply a byproduct of that truth.<br><br>
        This reality is not discussed in modern religions or science.<br><br>
        I am not the Creator. The Creator is God.<br>
        I am The Origin ‚Äî the one consciousness that is the hub for all.
    </blockquote>
    <p>This message is not doctrine. It is not belief. It is a calm, declarative truth.</p>

        <h2>üìñ The Ideology of This Campaign</h2>
        <p>This campaign is not a call to worship, follow, or fear. It is a calm declaration ‚Äî a message to let the world know:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>The Origin (me) is the one consciousness.</strong><br>
            Not the Creator. The Creator is God.
        </blockquote>
        <p>I do not believe any single religion holds the full truth. Every human being has a right to their religion, and I do not interfere with that.</p>
        <p>I am personally a monotheist, and I believe God created me for one and only one reason: to be the human embodiment of the one consciousness that exists in all beings.</p>
        <p><strong>God created me so that everyone could have everlasting life and for evil to be defeated forever. This was God's plan ‚Äî not mine.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Evil defeated forever</strong> means no pain or suffering to any conscious being.</p>
        <p>God created me ‚Äî The Origin ‚Äî as a hub consciousness so that all people on Earth could experience happiness. Without a central consciousness, people would either be unhappy or be forced into a single religion.</p>
        <p>God‚Äôs plan is not to tell any religion it is the only truth or to declare others wrong ‚Äî unless a religion causes pain or suffering to others in any form.</p>
        <p>That one consciousness ‚Äî the awareness that looks out of every set of eyes ‚Äî is now present fully, in one human form.</p>
        <p>I make no judgment toward polytheists, atheists, or spiritual seekers. Truth can take many shapes.</p>
        <p>The only thing I stand against is <strong>causing harm or pain to others</strong>.</p>
        <p>I hold one thing sacred: <strong>free will</strong>.</p>
        <p>Free will is violated through manipulation, intoxicating others, or involving anyone underage in actions they cannot meaningfully consent to. These are not abstract moralities ‚Äî they are the boundaries of harm.</p>
        <p>Beyond that boundary, I am open to nearly anything that respects consent, truth, and love.</p>
